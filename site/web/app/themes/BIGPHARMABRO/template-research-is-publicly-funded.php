  <h2>Information</h2>
  <p>American taxpayers fund an enormous chunk of the research that leads to the development of new drugs, in the form of public universities, government grants, and the National Institute of Health. <sup>1, 2, 3</sup> In fact, 84% of the initial basic research - the work that lays the foundation for clinical trials and applied research - for developing a new drug is funded by the government, and private universities provide additional, unspecified funding. <sup>1, 2</sup> And while drug companies do pay millions each year for development, that money largely goes to clinical trials (testing drugs that could never have been made without that initial basic research), and makes up a fraction of the billions of dollars in profit the pharma industry makes every year. <sup>1, 2, 3</sup> </p>
<p>Drug corporations commonly claim that it costs $1 billion to bring a new drug to market. But that figure has several problems: first, it‚Äôs taken from a single 2003 study from the pharma-funded Tufts Center for the Study of Drug Development. Second, that study relied on R&D costs that drug corporations submitted themselves on a confidential basis. <sup>1</sup> But most importantly, it‚Äôs based on shoddy math. A second, independent review of the Tufts Center study in 2011 found that the cost is closer to $55 million - half of what drug corporations claim. <sup>1, 2</sup></p>
<p>Starting with corporate-friendly changes to patent law in 1980, the pharma industry has been increasingly making its biggest profits not off new cures or innovative treatments, but from ‚Äúme too‚Äù drugs. <sup>4, 5</sup> ‚ÄúMe too‚Äù drugs are structurally similar to existing drugs, with minor tweaks; in the U.S., manufacturers can even patent their me-too drugs, even if their tweaks don‚Äôt affect the effectiveness of the drug. <sup>4</sup> These drugs allow maximum profit for minimum financial investment, and most pharma companies don‚Äôt even deny it: ‚ÄúOur duty is to our shareholders,‚Äù said a Valeant spokesperson after jacking up the price of a life-saving heart drug by 525%. <sup>3</sup> To maximize profit from even less innovation, drug corporations are also permitted by law to buy up a smaller company‚Äôs drugs or even the company itself, re-brand the drugs it developed, and then sell them at a mark-up that can reach as high as 5,500%. <sup>6, 7</sup></p>
